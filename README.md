##Build highly available, scalable, resilient distributed applications using Go

In this course, we'll develop a number of small, self-contained, loosely coupled microservices that will will communicate with one another and a simple front-end application with a REST API, with RPC, over gRPC, and by sending and consuming messages using AMQP, the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. The microservices we build will include the following functionality:

 - A Front End service, that just displays web pages;

 - An Authentication service, with a Postgres database;

 - A Logging service, with a MongoDB database;

 - A Listener service, which receives messages from RabbitMQ and acts upon them;

 - A Broker service, which is an optional single point of entry into the microservice cluster;

 - A Mail service, which takes a JSON payload, converts into a formatted email, and send it out.

All of these services will be written in Go, commonly referred to as Golang, a language which is particularly well suited to building distributed web applications.
